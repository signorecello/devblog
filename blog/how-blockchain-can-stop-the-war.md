Blockchain isn't really a political thing. And that's for a reason: it trusts in maths and economics, and not really in people. The whole idea of blockchain is removing trust from some equations envolving sensitive data and peoeple.

Given the war in Ukraine, if you're Russian, you should know that your taxes are being used to fund unjustified military incursions that bring terror to millions. I believe most of you agree that this is now where you thought your money was being applied.

So, how can blockchain stop this? I don't have an answer but I have some ideas to think about:

## The first casualty of war is truth

This old adage is more true than ever, at the present day. If you're like me and you're not a geopolitical expert, and if you dig a little bit, you can find sources of _truth_ on what exacly was Ukraine doing in the separatist states. You can also find _truth_ in where that's not really the case. Misinformation is the cancer of the XXI century, and there's no way of knowing where exactly does information come from. Ultimately, it always depends on what sources do you trust. If you trust the Russian channels, you hear one thing. If you trust western channels, you hear another.

Blockchain has some potential of removing some of this trust, leaving only the raw data. If information enters the blockchain as soon as possible to the source, there's less space for manipulation, and everyone absolutely needs to trust it.

Let's say that there's an explosion in an hospital in Kyiv. Authorities could go there, gather evidences, and in an ideal world, have a way to immediately convey it to a distributed trustless database like an Ethereum smart contract. Russian army can say one thing, and Ukraine defense can say another, but both parties would be able to convey raw data that cannot be manipulated by states and propaganda. Also, this would mean every piece of information has a timestamp and a owner, which is useful for further inquiry.

## Blockchain may be neutral. I'm not.

This quote from Vitalik says it all for me:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reminder: Ethereum is neutral, but I am not.</p>&mdash; vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1496695587495981056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Blockchain doesn't magically solve _people_. What it does solve is the amount of energy needed to maintain high levels of trust in each other.

When governments started imposing sanctions to Russia, I immediately thought that blockchain could be a workaround those sanctions. Banks can have their accounts locked by the SWIFT mechanism but they can still move cryptocurrencies with ease, as they don't rely on mutual trust like SWIFT does. 

However, as a miner, I was very happy to see the mining pool Flexpool.io blocking Russian miners. They can do that, because although Ethereum is neutral... They're not. The same can happen with exchanges, refusing to cash out fiat currencies to Russian nationals. This would effectively decrease the value of cryptocurrencies in Russia since they wouldn't represent real assets for anything meaningful, although they'd still have value everywhere else.
